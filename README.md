## ðŸ§  Key Topics Learned
Throughout the course, I explored and practiced:
1. **C Programming Fundamentals**  
   - Variables, data types, operators, and expressions.
2. **Control Structures**  
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
3. **Functions**  
   - Writing reusable code with user-defined and standard library functions.
4. **Arrays and Strings**  
   - Working with one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays, string manipulation.
5. **Pointers and Memory Management**  
   - Introduction to pointers, pointer arithmetic, and dynamic memory allocation.
6. **File I/O**  
   - Reading from and writing to files.
7. **Basic Problem-Solving Techniques**  
   - Applying algorithms to solve computational tasks.
